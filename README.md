# URL-Shortener-Nodejs
This is an URL shortener service like bit.ly or cutt.ly. The Front End is not covered here. The API service can take a long URL and convert it to a shorter URL. MongoDB is used as the database. The long URL, short URL, and other details are stored in the database. When a long URL that is already stored in the database is passed again, it returns the older shortened URL.
